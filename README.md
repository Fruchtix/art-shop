# art-shop
This is going to be an art shop for local art. The idea is that artists can create a profile and can list their art for sale. Individuals can then check out the artists profile and can purchase artworks over the platform directly.

The application will use React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & CSS Modules. Firebase firestore will handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook; authentication is used on all pages, which is handled by Firebase as well.
